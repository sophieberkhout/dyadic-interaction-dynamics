# Dyadic Interaction Dynamics

This repository accompanies the paper *A Tool to Simulate and Visualize Dyadic Interaction Dynamics* by S.W. Berkhout, N.K. Schuurman, and E.L. Hamaker (preprint). It introduces a Shiny app that allows researchers to simulate and visualize data from models that are used to analyze dyadic interaction dynamics. The Shiny app is available here: https://utrecht-university.shinyapps.io/dyadic-interaction-dynamics/.
