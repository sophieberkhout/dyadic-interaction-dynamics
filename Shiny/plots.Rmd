### Plots

* **Time-series**:
Plots the sequence of a partner's values against time.

* **Distribution**:
Plots a histogram and density of a partner's values.

* **Scatter plot auto**:
Plots a partner's value at time $t$ against itself at a previous occasion $t - 1$. The autocorrelation $r$ is also shown.

* **Scatter plot cross-lagged**:
Plots a partner's value at time $t$ against the other partner's value at a previous occasion $t - 1$. The cross-correlation $r$ is also shown.

* **3D state-space**:
A combination of the time-series plot and the carryover state-space. The line connects each occasion to the next occasion to show how the sequence develops over time.

* **Autocorrelation function**:
Plots the autocorrelation of a partner's values for different time lags.

* **Cross-correlation function**:
Plots the cross-correlation of both partner's values for different time lags.
